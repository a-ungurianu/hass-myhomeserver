# Bticino MyHomeSERVER

The Legrand/Bticino MyHomeSERVER integration for Home Assistant uses the
same HTTP-based API as the MyHome_UP mobile application.

This integration is currently a proof-of-concept and supports lights and
dimmers only.

The integration makes use of the *myhome* Python library, which can be found
at [https://github.com/speijnik/myhome] and contains some additional information
on how the API is being accessed.
